// Placeholder for future SHARP Memory LCD implementation
// SHARP Memory LCDs (e.g., LS027B7DH01A) are 400x240 monochrome displays
// with very low power consumption and excellent sunlight readability.
//
// Key characteristics:
// - Resolution: 400x240 (or other variants)
// - Monochrome (1-bit per pixel)
// - SPI interface
// - Ultra-low power consumption
// - Always-on display capability
// - No backlight required

// TODO: Implement SharpMemoryDriver following the same pattern as other drivers:
// - Support SPI interface
// - Handle display refresh requirements (periodic toggling)
// - Implement partial update support
// - Optimize for low power operation
